Kubernetes can run on various platforms:

        1) in your laptop
        2) in VMs on a cloud provider
        3) In a rack of bare metal servers
        
Various Approach 

        1) Local-machine Solutions
        2) Hosted Solutions
        3) Turnkey Cloud Solutions
        4) Custom Solution 
        
Local Machine Solutions (For Learning )

    
    1) Minikube 
    
       -    Creating a local, single-node Kubernetes cluster for development and testing.
       -    Setup is completely automated and doesnâ€™t require a cloud provider account.
    
    2) Kubeadm-dind 
    
       -    It is a multi-node (while minikube is single-node) Kubernetes cluster
       -    This only requires a docker daemon. 
       -    It uses docker-in-docker technique to spawn the Kubernetes cluster.
    
    3) Ubuntu on LXD 
    
       -    This supports a nine-instance deployment on localhost.
    
    4) IBM Cloud Private-CE (Community Edition) 
    
       -    It can use VirtualBox on your machine to deploy Kubernetes to one or more VMs for development and test scenarios.
       -    It Scales to full multi-node cluster.
    
    5) IBM Cloud Private-CE (Community Edition) on Linux Containers
     
       -    It is a Terraform/Packer/BASH based Infrastructure as Code (IaC) scripts to create a seven node (1 Boot, 1 Master, 1 Management, 1 Proxy and 3 Workers) LXD cluster on Linux Host.
