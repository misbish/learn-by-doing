    Docker Toolbox is for older Mac and Windows systems that do not meet the requirements of Docker for Mac and Docker for Windows.
    
    Toolbox includes these Docker tools:
        * Docker Machine for running docker-machine commands
        * Docker Engine for running the docker commands
        * Docker Compose for running the docker-compose commands
        * Kitematic, the Docker GUI
        * a shell preconfigured for a Docker command-line environment
        * Oracle VirtualBox
