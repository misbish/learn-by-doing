**Docker Service**

    A service only runs one image,
    but it codifies the way that image runs
        - what ports it should use,
        - how many replicas of the container should run so the service has the capacity it needs
          and so on
          
    Itâ€™s very easy to define, run, and scale services with the Docker platform 
    -- just write a docker-compose.yml file.   
    
`1. Define service with docker-compose.yml`

    version: "3"
    services:
      web:
        # replace username/repo:tag with your name and image details
        image: username/repo:tag
        deploy:
          replicas: 5
          resources:
            limits:
              cpus: "0.1"
              memory: 50M
          restart_policy:
            condition: on-failure
        ports:
          - "4000:80"
        networks:
          - webnet
    networks:
      webnet:   #load-balanced overlay network
      
  
  
`2. Start the cluster`

    docker swarm init
        
`3. Run the App`

    docker stack ls   #List stacks or apps    
    docker stack deploy -c docker-compose.yml <appname>
    
`4. Verify` 

    docker service ls       # List running services associated with an app
    docker service ps <service>     # List tasks associated with an app
    docker inspect <task or container>    # Inspect task or container
    
`5. Stop`

    docker stack rm <appname>       # Tear down an application
    docker swarm leave --force      # Take down a single node swarm from the manager
