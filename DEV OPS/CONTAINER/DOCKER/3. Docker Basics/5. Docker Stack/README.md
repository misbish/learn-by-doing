**Docker Stack**

    A stack is a group of interrelated services that share dependencies, and 
    can be orchestrated and scaled together. 
    
    docker stack ps <stack name>            # See the visualization 
    
    
    
A sample docker-compose.yml with 3 service 

    version: "3"   # This is mandatory , as docker stack deploy wont work with earlier version
    services:
      web:  #Service  name
        # replace username/repo:tag with your name and image details
        image: username/repo:tag

        deploy:

    version: "3" is mandatory 
    services key which contains all the service
    NOTE : There is a build key but , docker stack deploy does not suppport build, hence use pre built images
    depends_on - one service depend on other 
    deploy : new in version 3 , allows you to specify variiour properties of deployment
